## Full Description (4000 char)

Do you have a stand-alone freezer that has gotten out of control? Do you know what's in your freezer? If so, do you know how long it's been in there or when it should be used?

If the answer to these questions is "no" then the Icebox Freezer Manager app is for you!

Add your freezers. You can easily add your freezers to the app, with a description, the type of freezer, and optional shelf information.

Track what's in them. When you add an item to your freezer, add it to the app. When you remove something, you can change the quantity of the item in the app, or remove it altogether.

Peace of mind. The list of items in your freezer is sorted in the order the items need  to be used. A color-coded  display show how many days or months each item has before it needs to be used. No more wasting food when you find the unrecognizable block of ice in the back of your freezer!

It's your data. All the information is stored on your device, so there is no server to worry about and nobody else has access to your data.

Get your data. You can also, export your freezer and freezer item data to a human-readable file as a backup or to get access to your freezer data.

So, are you interested in making your life a little easier? Install the Icebox Freezer Manager.
