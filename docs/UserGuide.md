## Create a Freezer

From the app drawer, select the "Freezers" item to open the list of freezers (shown below). 

> SHOT: freezer list (empty)

Tap the add button (plus button in the lower right corner of the screen) to open the freezer editor.

> SHOT: freezer (adding - empty)

This screen allows you to give the freezer a name, a freezer type (Upright, Chest, or Drawer), along with an optional
list of shelves available in the freezer. The shelves are used to help populated the "location" information field found
in the freezer item entries. They may be re-ordered by long-pressing on them and dragging them up or down in the list. A
shelf may be removed by tapping the X on the right size of the entry.

When you are done creating your freezer, tap the Save button. You will be returned to the freezer list screen, with your
freezer now on the list (shown below).
